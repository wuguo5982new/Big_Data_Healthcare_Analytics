       "'Acromegaly is a disorder that results from excess growth hormone (GH) after the growth plates have closed. The initial symptom is typically enlargement of the hands and feet. There may also be an enlargement of the forehead, jaw, and nose. Other symptoms may include joint pain, thicker skin, deepening of the voice, headaches, and problems with vision. Complications of the disease may include type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure.Acromegaly is usually caused by the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone. In more than 95% of cases the excess production is due to a benign tumor, known as a pituitary adenoma. The condition is not inherited from a persons parents. Acromegaly is rarely due to a tumor in another part of the body. Diagnosis is by measuring growth hormone after a person has consumed a glucose solution, or by measuring insulin-like growth factor I in the blood. After diagnosis, medical imaging of the pituitary is carried out to determine if an adenoma is present. If excess growth hormone is produced during childhood, the result is the condition gigantism rather than acromegaly, and it is characterized by excessive height.Treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor, medications, and radiation therapy. Surgery is usually the preferred treatment; the smaller the tumor, the more likely surgery will be curative. If surgery is contraindicated or not curative, somatostatin analogues or GH receptor antagonists may be used. Radiation therapy may be used if neither surgery nor medications are completely effective. Without treatment, life expectancy is reduced by 10 years; with treatment, life expectancy is not reduced.Acromegaly affects about 3 per 50,000 people. It is most commonly diagnosed in middle age. Males and females are affected with equal frequency. It was first described in the medical literature by Nicolas Saucerotte in 1772. The term is from the Greek ἄκρον (akron) meaning \"extremity\", and μέγα (mega) meaning \"large\".\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\nFeatures that may result from a high level of GH or expanding tumor include:\\nHeadaches – often severe and prolonged\\nSoft tissue swelling visibly resulting in enlargement of the hands, feet, nose, lips, and ears, and a general thickening of the skin\\nSoft tissue swelling of internal organs, notably the heart with the attendant weakening of its muscularity, and the kidneys, also the vocal cords resulting in a characteristic thick, deep voice and slowing of speech\\nGeneralized expansion of the skull at the fontanelle\\nPronounced brow protrusion, often with ocular distension (frontal bossing)\\nPronounced lower jaw protrusion (prognathism) with attendant macroglossia (enlargement of the tongue) and teeth spacing\\nHypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation and hyperhidrosis may occur in these people.:\\u200a499\\u200a\\nSkin tags\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\\n\\nComplications\\nProblems with bones and joints, including osteoarthritis, nerve compression syndrome due to bony overgrowth, and carpal tunnel syndrome\\nHypertension\\nDiabetes mellitus\\nCardiomyopathy, potentially leading to heart failure\\nColorectal cancer\\nSleep Apnea\\nThyroid nodules and thyroid cancer\\nHypogonadism\\nCompression of the optic chiasm by the growth of pituitary adenoma leading to visual problems\\n\\nCauses\\nPituitary adenoma\\nAbout 98% of cases of acromegaly are due to the overproduction of growth hormone by a benign tumor of the pituitary gland called an adenoma. These tumors produce excessive growth hormone and compress surrounding brain tissues as they grow larger. In some cases, they may compress the optic nerves. Expansion of the tumor may cause headaches and visual disturbances. In addition, compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissue can alter production of other hormones, leading to changes in menstruation and breast discharge in women and impotence in men because of reduced testosterone production.A marked variation in rates of GH production and the aggressiveness of the tumor occurs. Some adenomas grow slowly and symptoms of GH excess are often not noticed for many years. Other adenomas grow rapidly and invade surrounding brain areas or the sinuses, which are located near the pituitary. In general, younger people tend to have more aggressive tumors.Most pituitary tumors arise spontaneously and are not genetically inherited. Many pituitary tumors arise from a genetic alteration in a single pituitary cell that leads to increased cell division and tumor formation. This genetic change, or mutation, is not present at birth but is acquired during life. The mutation occurs in a gene that regulates the transmission of chemical signals within pituitary cells; it permanently switches on the signal that tells the cell to divide and secrete growth hormones. The events within the cell that cause disordered pituitary cell growth and GH oversecretion currently are the subject of intensive research.Pituitary adenomas and diffuse somatomammotroph hyperplasia may result from somatic mutations activating GNAS, which may be acquired or associated with McCune-Albright syndrome.\\n\\nOther tumors\\nIn a few people, acromegaly is caused not by pituitary tumors, but by tumors of the pancreas, lungs, and adrenal glands. These tumors also lead to an excess of GH, either because they produce GH themselves or, more frequently, because they produce GHRH (growth hormone-releasing hormone), the hormone that stimulates the pituitary to make GH. In these people, the excess GHRH can be measured in the blood and establishes that the cause of the acromegaly is not due to a pituitary defect. When these nonpituitary tumors are surgically removed, GH levels fall and the symptoms of acromegaly improve.In people with GHRH-producing, non-pituitary tumors, the pituitary still may be enlarged and may be mistaken for a tumor. Therefore, it is important that physicians carefully analyze all \"pituitary tumors\" removed from people with acromegaly so as to not overlook the possibility that a tumor elsewhere in the body is causing the disorder.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\nIf acromegaly is suspected, medical laboratory investigations followed by medical imaging if the lab tests are positive confirms or rules out the presence of this condition.\\nIGF1 provides the most sensitive lab test for the diagnosis of acromegaly, and a GH suppression test following an oral glucose load, which is a very specific lab test, will confirm the diagnosis following a positive screening test for IGF1. A single value of the GH is not useful in view of its pulsatility (levels in the blood vary greatly even in healthy individuals). GH levels taken 2 hours after a 75- or 100-gram glucose tolerance test are helpful in the diagnosis: GH levels are suppressed below 1 μg/L in normal people, and levels higher than this cutoff are confirmatory of acromegaly.Other pituitary hormones must be assessed to address the secretory effects of the tumor, as well as the mass effect of the tumor on the normal pituitary gland. They include thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), gonadotropic hormones (FSH, LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin.An MRI of the brain focusing on the sella turcica after gadolinium administration allows for clear delineation of the pituitary and the hypothalamus and the location of the tumor. A number of other overgrowth syndromes can result in similar problems.\\n\\nDifferential diagnosis\\nPseudoacromegaly is a condition with the usual acromegaloid features, but without an increase in growth hormone and IGF-1. It is frequently associated with insulin resistance. Cases have been reported due to minoxidil at an unusually high dose. It can also be caused by a selective post receptor defect of insulin signalling, leading to the impairment of metabolic, but preservation of mitogenic, signalling.\\n\\nTreatment\\nThe goals of treatment are to reduce GH production to normal levels thereby reversing or ameliorating the signs and symptoms of acromegaly, to relieve the pressure that the growing pituitary tumor exerts on the surrounding brain areas, and to preserve normal pituitary function. Currently, treatment options include surgical removal of the tumor, drug therapy, and radiation therapy of the pituitary.\\n\\nMedications\\nSomatostatin analogues\\nThe primary current medical treatment of acromegaly is to use somatostatin analogues – octreotide (Sandostatin) or lanreotide (Somatuline).\\nThese somatostatin analogues are synthetic forms of a brain hormone, somatostatin, which stops GH production. The long-acting forms of these drugs must be injected every 2 to 4 weeks for effective treatment. Most people with acromegaly respond to this medication. In many people with acromegaly, GH levels fall within one hour and headaches improve within minutes after the injection. Octreotide and lanreotide are effective for long-term treatment. Octreotide and lanreotide have also been used successfully to treat people with acromegaly caused by non-pituitary tumors.Somatostatin analogues are also sometimes used to shrink large tumors before surgery.Because octreotide inhibits gastrointestinal and pancreatic function, long-term use causes digestive problems such as loose stools, nausea, and gas in one third of people. In addition, approximately 25 percent of people with acromegaly develop gallstones, which are usually asymptomatic. In some cases, octreotide treatment can cause diabetes due to the fact that somatostatin and its analogues can inhibit the release of insulin. With an aggressive adenoma that is not able to be operated on, there may be a resistance to octreotide and in which case a second generation SSA, pasireotide, may be used for tumor control. However, insulin and glucose levels should be carefully monitored as pasireotide has been associated with hyperglycemia by reducing insulin secretion.\\n\\nDopamine agonists\\nFor those who are unresponsive to somatostatin analogues, or for whom they are otherwise contraindicated, it is possible to treat using one of the dopamine agonists, bromocriptine or cabergoline. As tablets rather than injections, they cost considerably less. These drugs can also be used as an adjunct to somatostatin analogue therapy. They are most effective in those whose pituitary tumours cosecrete prolactin. Side effects of these dopamine agonists include gastrointestinal upset, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness when standing, and nasal congestion. These side effects can be reduced or eliminated if medication is started at a very low dose at bedtime, taken with food, and gradually increased to the full therapeutic dose. Bromocriptine lowers GH and IGF-1 levels and reduces tumor size in fewer than half of people with acromegaly. Some people report improvement in their symptoms although their GH and IGF-1 levels still are elevated.\\n\\nGrowth hormone receptor antagonists\\nThe latest development in the medical treatment of acromegaly is the use of growth hormone receptor antagonists. The only available member of this family is pegvisomant (Somavert). By blocking the action of the endogenous growth hormone molecules, this compound is able to control the disease activity of acromegaly in virtually everyone with acromegaly. Pegvisomant has to be administered subcutaneously by daily injections. Combinations of long-acting somatostatin analogues and weekly injections of pegvisomant seem to be equally effective as daily injections of pegvisomant.\\n\\nSurgery\\nSurgical removal of the pituitary tumor is usually effective in lowering growth hormone levels. Two surgical procedures are available for use. The first is endonasal transsphenoidal surgery, which involves the surgeon reaching the pituitary through an incision in the nasal cavity wall. The wall is reached by passing through the nostrils with microsurgical instruments. The second method is transsphenoidal surgery during which an incision is made into the gum beneath the upper lip. Further incisions are made to cut through the septum to reach the nasal cavity, where the pituitary is located. Endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is a less invasive procedure with a shorter recovery time than the older method of transsphenoidal surgery, and the likelihood of removing the entire tumor is greater with reduced side effects. Consequently, endonasal transsphenoidal surgery is the more common surgical choice.These procedures normally relieve the pressure on the surrounding brain regions and lead to a lowering of GH levels. Surgery is most successful in people with blood GH levels below 40 ng/ml before the operation and with pituitary tumors no larger than 10 mm in diameter. Success depends on the skill and experience of the surgeon. The success rate also depends on what level of GH is defined as a cure. The best measure of surgical success is the normalization of GH and IGF-1 levels. Ideally, GH should be less than 2 ng/ml after an oral glucose load. A review of GH levels in 1,360 people worldwide immediately after surgery revealed that 60% had random GH levels below 5 ng/ml. Complications of surgery may include cerebrospinal fluid leaks, meningitis, or damage to the surrounding normal pituitary tissue, requiring lifelong pituitary hormone replacement.Even when surgery is successful and hormone levels return to normal, people must be carefully monitored for years for possible recurrence. More commonly, hormone levels may improve, but not return completely to normal. These people may then require additional treatment, usually with medications.\\n\\nRadiation therapy\\nRadiation therapy has been used both as a primary treatment and combined with surgery or drugs. It is usually reserved for people who have tumor remaining after surgery. These people often also receive medication to lower GH levels. Radiation therapy is given in divided doses over four to six weeks. This treatment lowers GH levels by about 50 percent over 2 to 5 years. People monitored for more than 5 years show significant further improvement. Radiation therapy causes a gradual loss of production of other pituitary hormones with time. Loss of vision and brain injury, which have been reported, are very rare complications of radiation treatments.\\n\\nSelection of treatment\\nThe initial treatment chosen should be individualized depending on the persons characteristics, such as age and tumor size. If the tumor has not yet invaded surrounding brain tissues, removal of the pituitary adenoma by an experienced neurosurgeon is usually the first choice. After surgery, a person must be monitored long-term for increasing GH levels.If surgery does not normalize hormone levels or a relapse occurs, a doctor will usually begin additional drug therapy. The current first choice is generally octreotide or lanreotide; however, bromocriptine and cabergoline are both cheaper and easier to administer. With all of these medications, long-term therapy is necessary, because their withdrawal can lead to rising GH levels and tumor re-expansion.Radiation therapy is generally used for people whose tumors are not completely removed by surgery, for people who are not good candidates for surgery because of other health problems, and for people who do not respond adequately to surgery and medication.\\n\\nPrognosis\\nLife expectancy of people with acromegaly is dependent on how early the disease is detected. Life expectancy after the successful treatment of early disease is equal to that of the general population. Acromegaly can often go on for years before diagnosis, resulting in poorer outcome, and it is suggested that the better the growth hormone is controlled, the better the outcome. Upon successful surgical treatment, headaches and visual symptoms tend to resolve. One exception is sleep apnea, which is present in around 70% of cases, but does not tend to resolve with successful treatment of growth hormone level. While hypertension is a complication of 40% of cases, it typically responds well to regular regimens of blood pressure medication. Diabetes that occurs with acromegaly is treated with the typical medications, but successful lowering of growth hormone levels often alleviates symptoms of diabetes. Hypogonadism without gonad destruction is reversible with treatment. Acromegaly is associated with a slightly elevated risk of cancer.\\n\\nNotable people\\nFamous people with acromegaly include:\\n\\nDaniel Cajanus (1704–1749), \"The Finnish Goliath\". His natural size portrait and femur are still extant. His height was estimated to have been 247 cm (8 1\").\\nMary Ann Bevan (1874–1933), an English woman, who after developing acromegaly, toured the sideshow circuit as \"the ugliest woman in the world\".\\nAndré the Giant (born André Roussimoff, 1946–1993), French professional wrestler and actor\\nSalvatore Baccaro (1932–1984), Italian character actor.

Descriptions, as well as depictions, indicate acromegaly, though remains of his body are yet to be found.\\nThe Great Khali (born Dalip Singh Rana), Indian professional wrestler, is best known for his tenure with WWE. He had his pituitary tumor removed in 2012 at age 39.\\nPrimo Carnera (1906–1967), nicknamed the Ambling Alp, was an Italian professional boxer and wrestler who reigned as the boxing World Heavyweight Champion from 29 June 1933 to 14 June 1934.\\nMaurice Tillet (1903–1954), Russian-born French professional wrestler, is better known by his ring name, the French Angel.\\nRichard Kiel (1939–2014), actor, \"Jaws\" from two James Bond movies and Mr. Larson in Happy Gilmore\\nPío Pico, the last Mexican Governor of California (1801–1894), manifested acromegaly without gigantism between at least 1847 and 1858. Some time after 1858, signs of the growth hormone-producing tumor disappeared along with all the secondary effects the tumor had caused in him. He looked normal in his 90s. His remarkable recovery is likely an example of spontaneous selective pituitary tumor apoplexy.\\nEarl Nightingale (March 12, 1921 – March 25, 1989) was an American radio speaker and author, dealing mostly with the subjects of human character development, motivation, and meaningful existence. He was the voice during the early 1950s of Sky King, the hero of a radio adventure series, and was a WGN radio program host from 1950 to 1956.

Her history is also significant for likely recurrent aspiration pneumonia and intubation earlier on this admission as well.  Previously while treating this patient I had met with the family and discussed how aggressive the patient would wish her level of care to be given that there was evidence of possible ovarian malignancy with elevated CA-125 and a complex mass located in the ovary.  As the patient was showing signs of improvement with some speech and ability to follow commands, decision was made to continue to pursue an aggressive level of care, treat her dysphagia, hypertension, debilitation and this was being done.  However, last night the patient had apparently catastrophic event around 2:40 in the morning.  Rapid response was called and the patient was intubated, started on pressure support, and given CPR.  This morning I was called to the bedside by nursing stating the family had wished at this point not to continue this aggressive level of care.  The patient was seen and examined, she was intubated and sedated.  Limbs were cool.  Cardiovascular exam revealed tachycardia.  Lungs had coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen was soft.  Extremities were cool to the touch.  Pupils were 6 to 2 mm, doll's eyes were not intact.  They were not responsive to light.  Based on discussion with all family members involved including both sons, daughter and daughter-in-law, a decision was made to proceed with terminal wean and comfort care measures.  All pressure support was discontinued.  The patient was started on intravenous morphine and respiratory was requested to remove the ET tube.  Monitors were turned off and the patient was made as comfortable as possible.  Family is at the bedside at this time.  The patient appears comfortable and the family is in agreement that this would be her wishes per my understanding of the family and the patient dynamics over the past month, this is a very reasonable and appropriate approach given the patient's failure to turn around after over a month of aggressive treatment with likely terminal illness from ovarian cancer and associated comorbidities.,Total time spent at the bedside today in critical care services, medical decision making and explaining options to the family and proceeding with terminal weaning was excess of 37 minutes.general medicine, full code status, terminal wean, comfort care, cpr, advanced cardiac life support, care conference, family, bedsideNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

They all consented for the procedure, and the consent was signed and placed on the chart.,PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to cardiac cath lab where she was monitored throughout all procedure.  The area of the left pectoral deltoid and subclavian area was sterilely prepped and draped in the usual manner.  We also scrubbed for approximately eight minutes.  Using lidocaine with epinephrine, the area of the left pectoral deltoid region and subclavian area was then fully anesthetized.  Using an #18 gauge Cook needle, the left subclavian vein was cannulated at two separate sites without difficulty, where two separate guidewires were inserted into the left subclavian vein.  The Cook needles were removed.  Then the guidewires were secured in place with hemostat.  Using a #10 and #15 scalpel blade, a 5 cm horizontal incision was made in the left pectodeltoid groove, where the skin was dissected and blunted on to the pectoralis major muscle.  The skin was then undermined making a pocket for the generator.  The guidewires were then tunneled through the performed pocket.  Subsequently, the atrial and ventricular leads were inserted through each one of the Cordis separately and respectively.  Initially, the ventricular lead was inserted, where a Cordis sheath was placed and the guidewire was removed.  After the thresholds and appropriate position was obtained for the ventricular lead, the Cordis sheath was then inserted for the atrial lead.  After the atrial lead was inserted and appropriately placed and thresholds were obtained, the Cordis was removed and then both leads were sutured in place with pectoralis major muscle with #1-0 silk suture.  The leads were then connected to a pulse generator.  The pocket was then irrigated and cleansed, where then the leads and the generators were inserted into that pocket.  The subcutaneous tissue was then closed with gut sutures and the skin was then closed with #4-0 polychrome sutures using a subcuticular uninterrupted technique.  The area was then cleansed and dry.  Steri-Strips and pressure dressing were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

       "   \"REASON FOR FOLLOWUP:,  Care conference with family at the bedside and decision to change posture of care from aggressive full code status to terminal wean with comfort care measures in a patient with code last night with CPR and advanced cardiac life support.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 65-year-old patient originally admitted by me several weeks ago with profound hyponatremia and mental status changes.  Her history is also significant for likely recurrent aspiration pneumonia and intubation earlier on this admission as well.  Previously while treating this patient I had met with the family and discussed how aggressive the patient would wish her level of care to be given that there was evidence of possible ovarian malignancy with elevated CA-125 and a complex mass located in the ovary.  As the patient was showing signs of improvement with some speech and ability to follow commands, decision was made to continue to pursue an aggressive level of care, treat her dysphagia, hypertension, debilitation and this was being done.  However, last night the patient had apparently catastrophic event around 2:40 in the morning.  Rapid response was called and the patient was intubated, started on pressure support, and given CPR.  This morning I was called to the bedside by nursing stating the family had wished at this point not to continue this aggressive level of care.  The patient was seen and examined, she was intubated and sedated.  Limbs were cool.  Cardiovascular exam revealed tachycardia.  Lungs had coarse breath sounds.  Abdomen was soft.  Extremities were cool to the touch.  Pupils were 6 to 2 mm, doll's eyes were not intact.  They were not responsive to light.  Based on discussion with all family members involved including both sons, daughter and daughter-in-law, a decision was made to proceed with terminal wean and comfort care measures.  All pressure support was discontinued.  The patient was started on intravenous morphine and respiratory was requested to remove the ET tube.  Monitors were turned off and the patient was made as comfortable as possible.  Family is at the bedside at this time.  The patient appears comfortable and the family is in agreement that this would be her wishes per my understanding of the family and the patient dynamics over the past month, this is a very reasonable and appropriate approach given the patient's failure to turn around after over a month of aggressive treatment with likely terminal illness from ovarian cancer and associated comorbidities.,Total time spent at the bedside today in critical care services, medical decision making and explaining options to the family and proceeding with terminal weaning was excess of 37 minutes.general medicine, full code status, terminal wean, comfort care, cpr, advanced cardiac life support, care conference, family, bedsideNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

She was placed in the left lateral position and was given IV Demerol and Versed for sedation.  When adequate level of sedation achieved, the gastroscope was inserted into the hypopharynx and the esophagus was easily intubated.  At the GE junction, a hiatal hernia was present.  There were mild inflammatory changes consistent with reflux esophagitis.  The scope was then passed into the stomach.  It was insufflated and the scope was coursed along the greater curvature to the antrum.  The pylorus was patent.  There was evidence of bile reflux in the antrum.  The duodenal bulb and sweep were examined and were without evidence of mass, ulceration, or inflammation.  The scope was then brought back into the antrum.,A retroflexion was attempted multiple times, however, the patient was having difficulty holding the air and adequate retroflexion view was not visualized.  The gastroscope was then slowly withdrawn.  There were no other abnormalities noted in the fundus or body.  Once again at the GE junction, esophageal biopsy was taken.  The scope was then completely withdrawn.  The patient tolerated the procedure and was transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.  She will return to the General Medical Floor.  We will continue b.i.d proton-pump inhibitor therapy as well as dietary restrictions.

There are no carotid bruits.  Visible skin warm and perfused.  Affect appropriate.  He is quite oriented and pleasant.  No significant kyphoscoliosis on recumbent back exam.  Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly.  No wheezes.  No egophony.  Cardiac Exam:  S1, S2.  Regular rate, controlled.  No significant murmurs, rubs or gallops.  PMI is nondisplaced.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, appears benign.  Extremities without significant edema.  Pulses grossly intact.,DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES/LAB DATA:,  Initial ECG shows atrial flutter.,IMPRESSION: , Mr. A is a 50-year-old gentleman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the past, more recently is having breakthrough atrial flutter despite flecainide and we had performed a transesophageal echocardiogram-guided cardioversion for him in late 12/20/09, who now has another recurrence within the past 41 hours or so.  I have reviewed again with him in detail regarding risks, benefits, and alternatives of proceeding with cardioversion, which the patient is in favor of.  After in depth explanation of the procedure with him that there would be more definitive resumption of normal sinus rhythm by using electrocardioversion with less long-term side effects, past the acute procedure, alternatives being continued atrial flutter with potential for electrophysiologic consultation for ablation and/or heart rate control with anticoagulation, which the patient was not interested nor was I primarily recommending as the next step, and risks including, but not limited to and the patient was aware and this was all done in the presence of his wife that this is not an all-inclusive list, but the risks include but not limited to oversedation from conscious sedation, risk of aspiration pneumonia from regurgitation of stomach contents, which would be less likely as I did confirm with the patient that he had been n.p.o. for greater than 15 hours, risk of induction of other arrhythmias including tachyarrhythmias requiring further management including cardioversion or risk of bradyarrhythmias, in the past when we had a cardioverter with 150 joules, he did have a 5.5-second pause especially while he is on antiarrhythmic therapy, statistically less significant risk of CVA, although we cannot really make that null.  The patient expressed understanding of this risk, benefit, and alternative analysis.  I invited questions from him and his wife and once their questions were answered to their self-stated satisfaction, we planned to go forward with the procedure.,PROCEDURE NOTE:  ,The patient received a total of 7 mg of Versed and 50 micrograms of fentanyl utilizing titrate-down sedation with good effect and this was after the appropriate time-out procedure had been done as per the Medical Center universal protocol with appropriate identification of the patient, position, procedure documentation, procedure indication, and there were no questions.  The patient did actively participate in this time-out procedure.  After the universal protocol was done, he then received the cardioversion attempt with 50 joules using \"lollipop posterior patch\" with hands-driven paddle on the side, which was 50 joules of synchronized biphasic energy.  There was successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm, in fact this time there was not a significant pause as compared to when he had this done previously in late 12/09 and this sinus rhythm was confirmed by a 12-lead EKG.,IMPRESSION: , Cardioversion shows successful resumption of normal sinus rhythm from atrial flutter and that is while the patient has been maintained on Coumadin and his INR is 3.22.  We are going to watch him and discharge him from the Medical Center area on his current flecainide of 200 mg in the morning and 100 mg in the evening, atenolol 25 mg once a day, Coumadin _____ as currently being diagnosed.  I had previously discussed with the patient and he was agreeable with meeting with his electrophysiologist again, Dr. X, at Electrophysiology Unit at General Hospital and I will be planning to place a call for Dr. X myself.  Again, he has no ischemia on this most recent stress test and I suppose in the future it may be reasonable to get obstructive sleep apnea evaluation and that may be one issue promulgating his symptoms.,I had previously discussed the case with Dr. Y who is the patient\\'s general cardiologist as well as updated his wife at the patient\\'s bedside regarding our findings.nan']]}"
